 GER_Schut_desc:0 "Founded to safeguard the personal safety of the Führer, the Schutzstaffel's most defining chief was Heinrich Himmler. Under his ambitious leadership the SS grew to become the vast organisation that it was. Members swore a personal oath to Hitler, each stating that 'Meine Ehre heißt Treue' - that their honour would guarantee their loyalty."
 GER_Knifed:0 "Night of the Long Knifes"
 GER_Knifed_desc:0 "Under Ernst Röhm the paramilitary detachment has become far too influential and needs to be dealt with. His brownshirts were once vital in suppressing protests at rallies and speeches but have now become a force to be reckoned with. To reign in their ambitions and consolidate total control over the NSDAP, dismemberement is going to be the only option. The purge was known as the Night of the Long Knives."

 GER_Jewis:0 "Volksgemeinschaft"
 GER_tripartite:0 "Tripartite Pact"
 GER_staatenbund_desc:0 "Our foreign minister von Ribbentrop has advanced the idea of European Confederation, with Germany at the helm. The main idea is to unite Europe, showing the world that it stands as one against its enemies, defending the independence of its smaller members. It would also draw in neutral states and open up new economic opportunities for our civil economies and it would merit Pan-European infrastructure."
 GER_tripartite_desc:0 "We can take the Anti-Comintern Pact one step further and ask all members to commit to a coalition against the Soviet Union. If any signatory ends up at war with the USSR, all other members must also declare war."
 GER_Puppet_Bulgaria:0 "Secure the Balkans"
 GER_danube_desc:0 "Germany's influence in the Danubian Basin grew with the annexation of Austria, but now the time has come to consolidate our hold on the region. By supporting our puppets we can drive out the remaining Italian influence, and perhaps we can even turn the area around the Iron Gate into a pale of German settlement - strategically located at a geographical bottleneck - calling it the Prinz-Eugen-Gau."
 GER_aryan_kinship_desc:0 "Iran is the homeland of the Aryan race, and naturally the Iranian people are fellow kin and thus immune to our racial laws. To make our fellow Aryans aware of our common heritage we should encourage them to delve into their history, providing them with the scientific means to to do so."
 GER_danube:0 "Seize Rule Over the Danube"

 GER_Army_SS_desc:0 "The Waffen SS was the military branch of the SS organisation, only accepting men who could comply with strict physical standards. Highly motivated, training involved not only military aspects but also a wider ideological understanding of the national socialist cause.

When operation Barbarossa was in full swing membership was opened up to non Germanic groups from Eastern Europe. As the war progressed, foreign volunteers and conscripts made up half of the Waffen SS, in effect creating what could be called the first pan-European army."
 GER_Plankalkul:0 "Plankalkül"
 GER_Plankalkul_desc:0 "Plan Calculus was an effort to create the very first high-level programming language for computers, the brainchild of Konrad Zuse. Writing started in 1942 on his 'Rechenplan', what he called a computer program, but due to the end of the war his ideas were never completed; His proposal to devise an algorithmic language never attained the consideration it deserved."

 GER_gotenland_desc:0 "By conceiving a master plan for the east Germany can secure vast tracts of land as Lebensraum. One such vital region is the Crimean Peninsula with its mild climate and strategical positioning in the Black Sea.

 GER_OP_ikarus:0 "Operation Ikarus"
 GER_OP_ikarus_desc:0 "The fall of Britain leaves a strain of unprotected islands that could serve as a potential springboard into Europe for our enemies.

 GER_amerikaproject_desc:0 "Design work on the A10 rocket began in 1940, for a projected first flight to take place in 1946. It was to reach American soil from launch bases in Europe, and was guided by a pilot brave enough for the terminal journey."
 GER_support_ira:0 "Support the IRA"

 GER_fall_grunn:0 "Fall Grün"
 GER_fall_grunn_desc: "Case Green was the codename for the invasion of Ireland in support of Sealion. The plan contains detailed descriptions and objectives, but revealed that supply and logistics proved to be a difficult problem to solve.

 GER_fortress_eire:0 "Fortress Eire"
 GER_fortress_eire_desc:0 "Ideally situated to the west of Britain, the emerald isle poses a geopolitical threat to the security of Europe. A hostile or neutral controlled Ireland poses an appealing starting point for a wider European military campaign, one that must be avoided at all cost."

 GER_nationalist_ireland_desc:0 "The aim of the IRA was to unite the whole island under one Irish banner, removing any British political influence in the process.

 GER_madagaskar:0 "Madagaskar Plan"
 GER_madagaskar_desc:0 "Shortly before the fall of France in 1940, German officials called for the resettlement of jews as far away from Europe as possible.

 GER_Nordmark:0 "Protectorate Nordmark"
 GER_nordmark_desc:0 "Denmark maintained a large degree of self rule and Contrary to the Low Countries, no real incorporation plans were drawn up. Neverthelees, during the war the Danish populace and its leaders were unwillingly compliant to their German occupants, resulting in a relative ease of the occupation, granting it the name of 'model protectorate'."
 GER_eternal:0 "Arbeitseinsatz"
 GER_eternal_desc:0 "Our society and economy is in dire need for workers. This labour shortage can be easily solved by forcing citizens from occupied countries to work in our factories, communities, and farms. In 1945 some 7.7 million non-German workers were forced to participate in Germany's economy."
 GER_Luftwafe:0 "Luftwaffe"
 GER_Luftwafe_desc:0 "Since the Versailles Treaty stipulated Germany was forbidden from having an air force, training of pilots was conducted in secrecy with the help of the Soviet Union. In 1935 the Luftwaffe was officially established and Germany had an air arms again, experiencing its first action in the Spanish civil war aiding Franco's forces. It was lead by Hermann Göring, a veteran world war I fighter pilot ace."
 GER_Luflander:0 "Luftlandetruppen"
 GER_Luflander_desc:0 "Commanded by Kurt Student throughout the war, Germany's airborne forces mainly consisted of Fallschirmjäger divisions, highly trained soldiers in commando style raiding. Used in neutralising the Belgian fortress of Eben Emael as well as with the invasion of the Netherlands, their last large scale parachute and glider performance took place in Crete."
 GER_Amerika:0 "Amerikabomber"
 GER_achtung_panzer_desc:0 "A book by Heinz Guderian, it advocated for a wide spread use of tanks and motorised or mechanised infantry to replace the historical tactical role fullfilled by cavalry. This meant that tanks had to be organised in dedicated panzer units, supported by mobile infantry and artillery. It was key to enhance battlefield cooperation and maneuvre by outfitting panzers with radios and intercoms."
 GER_Amerika_desc:0 "A project for long-range strategic bombing, the concept sought to develop a bomber for the Luftwaffe able to cross the 5.800 kilometres of the Atlantic to strike America on home soil. Using the Azores as an air base, airplanes were to carry a payload of up to 6.5 tonnes to reach the densily populated American East Coast and put iconic cities such as New York in flames."
 GER_Bli:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 GER_blitzkrieg_desc:0 "A combined arms doctrine that coordinated military effort of tanks, paratroopers, aircraft, artillery, and motorised infantry, to create overwhelming local superiority in combat power. Especially effective on narrow fronts, such as in the West, the name Blitzkrieg was not offically adopted but remained a useful propaganda term to describe Germany's seemingly unstoppable army."
 GER_afrika:0 "Afrikakorps"
 GER_soviet_ally:0 "Berlin-Moscow Axis"

 GER_afrika_desc:0 "After nominating Erwin Rommel as head of the expeditionary force Afrikakorps, it was sent to North Africa to shore up the Italian defences in Libya. Initially successfull, the goal of the military campaign was to march on Cairo and endanger the British held Suez Canal as the eastern entrance point to the Mediterranean Sea."
 GER_Versay:0 "Denounce the Versailles Treaty"
 GER_Versay_desc:0 ""
 GER_commercial_desc:0 "Economic agreements with the USSR will help us both. We receive much needed raw material, namely oil and chromium, while the Soviets will gain new technology and German consumer goods in return. Furthermore, this commercial treaty will allow Germany to circumvent any blockade at sea, making it no longer dependent on seaborne trade."
 GER_mittelafrika_desc:0 "During the First World War planners already entertained the idea of a large German controlled colony in Central Africa. By bolstering the new South African state and by granting concessions to our Spanish and Italian allies we can finally fulfill our dream of Empire. The reorganisation of Africa will eliminate all British influence on the continent and the French will be put down considerably."
 GER_support_arab_desc:0 "A new national consciousness among the Arabs has risen. By supporting Arab Nationalism the void that has been left by the Ottoman Empire and the other imperialist powers can be filled, so that long term stability can be attained."
 GER_arab_republic_desc:0 "The Arabs had been promised their own state by the British in the Levant for fighting against the Ottoman Empire, but British diplomacy has left them waiting. We can still act on their desire by forming the Greater Arab Union through the appeal of Pan-Arabism, and thus secure the Middle East and guarantee a safe passage through the Suez Canal for our vessels."
 GER_support_apartheid_desc:0 "The architect of apartheid, doctor Verwoerd, envisioned a South Africa organised along racial lines. Verwoerd studied in Germany and became active in South African politics supporting Afrikaner Nationalism. By acknowledging the plight of the Boers we can help them in developing the idea of Apartheid in South Africa, alligning them with the National-Socialist doctrine."
 GER_third_boer_war_desc:0 "Dutch descendants in South Afrika have been agitating for their own state with the help of organisations such as the Ossewabrandwag and the Stormjaers. Earlier this yearning for self determination lead to two violent clashes with the British Imperialists in what is known as the Boer wars. Our duty is to aid them in their struggle and prepare them for another attempt at statehood."
 GER_Finka:0 "Northern Flank"
 GER_Finka_desc:0 "In 1942 the Führer denied the Finnish request to become a protectorate of Germany after their first conflict with the Soviets. By offering Finland the land north of the Neva river, as well as the Kola peninsula and Karelia proper, the Finns will be once more enticed to become a march of the new Germany."
 GER_Osttrupen:0 "Osttruppen"
 GER_Osttrupen_desc:0 "Not all peoples living in the Soviet Union enjoyed its suppressive regime, and many are more than happy to rise up against their former rulers. Some 400.000 Eastern Europeans served in combat roles, mainly in the western theatre, while thousands more volunteered as 'Hiwi's' to carry out work for the Germans, as labourers, drivers, interpreters, etc."
 GER_OP_Felix:0 "Unternehmen Felix"
 GER_op_felix_desc:0 "Seizing the British territory of Gibraltar is essential for controlling the western entrance to the Mediterranean. Once enough forces can be withdrawn from the eastern front - after taking the cities of Kiev and Smolennsk - Germany can commit itself on driving the British out of the Mediterranean for once and for all, by putting its special forces to good strategic use."
 GER_Heim:0 "Heim ins Reich"
 GER_heim_desc:0 "German foreign policy known as Heim ins Reich was aimed at bringing these people home in the Empire. All across Europe, from Tyrol, the Baltics, the former kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Rumania, and the USSR, a total of 2 million ethnic Germans - Volksdeutsche - were resettled in newly aquired territory, chiefly in western in Poland."
 GER_Mosseland:0 "Gau Moselland"
 GER_Mosseland_desc:0 "After the invasion of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, the country was put through a rigorous agenda of Germanisation; citizens with French surnames were forced to take on German ones, place names were Germanised, and a recruiment drive for the army took place. All these measures were intended to prepare Luxemburg for its inevitable annexation into the Reich."
 GER_Wesmark:0 "Westmark and Oberrhein"
 GER_umvolking_desc:0 "The Czechs have been rather forthcoming in their new political situation. Therefore, preperations for the cultural shift in Bohemia and Moravia were already proposed in 1940. Over the years the Czechs would be germanised, with the exception of those hostile to the new regime."
 GER_Westmark_desc:0 "At the armistice of Compgiègne in 1940 the Germans factually re-annexed the lost region of Elsaß-Lothringen. The department of Moselle was brought under the supervision of the newly formed Gau Westmark - which was the amalgamation of the Saarland with the Palatinate, while the two departments of the Elsaß merged with Baden in 1944, with its new capital at Straßburg."
 GER_Wallonien:0 "Wallonien and Flandern"
 GER_zukunftsflotte_desc:0 "The Führer foresaw a larger, bigger, more massive fleet than any other nation would operate. This new plan for a future navy had no relation with the previous Z Plan and never left the concept stage. But who says the Kriegsmarine is unable to successfully challange the British navy?"
 GER_panzerschiffe_desc:0 "These armored ships officialy fall within the ambit of the Versailles treaty, thus allowing us to strengthen the German surface fleet with a new class of heavy cruisers. These fast, long range Panzerkreuzer will enable us to pursue British commerce vessels on the High Sea."
 GER_polish_aliance_desc:0 "Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union. With Pilsudski now in power this might just become a reality. After all, Poland must choose a side or fear being partitioned."
 GER_wallonien_desc:0 "In 1944 both Reichsgau Flandern and Reichsgau Wallonien were established and became an integral part of Greater Germany, thereby absolving Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich into two halves. All this time the Lower Franconians in Flanders have retained their Germanism and can easily be absorbed into the Reich, whereas the Walloons have to be made self-aware of their lost heritage."
 GER_Westland:0 "Reichsgau Westland"
 GER_retool_desc:0 "The Czechs have built up an impressive industrial capacity, including their own industrial military complex with companies such as Skoda. The Reich should harness this potential and retool Bohemian industry to serve the needs of the German war machine, putting skilled Czech craftsmen to good use."
 GER_Westland_desc:0 "Reichsgau Westland was the proposed annexation of the Netherlands into the planned expansion of Greater Germany. During the time of civil administration of the ocupied Netherlands German authorities aimed at winning the Dutch over for National Socialism and bringing their culture in line with that of the Reich through various programmes, eventually realising their 'Eindeutschung'."
 GER_Tane:0 "Operation Tannenbaum"
 GER_tane_desc:0 "Soon after the successfull invasion of France, German High Command, under the orders of the Führer, started preparations for the invasion of Switzerland; Damaged infrastructure in France was repaired and German troops were stationed near the Swiss border, ready for the the surprise attack on Swizterland.

 GER_Aktion_S:0 "Aktion S"
 GER_trade_tyrol_desc:0 "To improve relations with Italy we have revoked our claims on South Tyrol, but the social issue remains as the Germans of South Tyrol want to join the new Reich. It also happens that Mussolini laid his eyes on the Italian speaking parts of Switzerland, which is currently controlled by us. Perhaps Hitler and Mussolini could come to an arrangement on the matter?"

Whether we can catch the French fleet off guard in the port of Toulon remains to be seen..."
 GER_Westraum:0 "Establish the Westraum"
 GER_Westraum_desc:0 "As the new Western Frontier between the Rhine and the new border to the west, the concept of the Westraum served as the legitimation behind the annexation of more French lands. Preparations were already made with the invasion of France by prohibiting French refugees from returning to their homes, so that ultimately Germany's borders can be pushed even further west."
 GER_italian_land:0 "Italian Lands"
 GER_italian_land_desc:0 "Italian territorial ambitions included plans to annex French territory up to the river Rhone, including the cities of Nice and Marsailles, as well as the region of Savoy and the island of Corsica.

 GER_Sealowe:0 "Operation Sealion"
 GER_Sealowe_desc:0 "After denying many of Hitler's peace proposals, it became clear that only a full blown invasion of Albion could make the British understand their new role at Germany's side.

 GER_OP_Isabella:0 "Operation Isabella"

 GER_panske:0 "Operation Paukenschlag"
 GER_panske_desc:0 "America has been sending state aid to Britain thinking it can remain neutral in the conflict, but now Germany is at war with the U.S.A., and the transatlantic shipping routes can finally be raided by our submarines - unrestricted.

The largest of these had walls up to 3.5 meters thick, and could sustain up to 8.000 rounds of fire per minute. Considered invulnerable to anything the allies could bomb it with at the time of its completion, it also did service as a bunker, housing up to 30.000 people."
 GER_Mettal:0 "MEFO Bills"
 GER_Mettal_desc:0 "An idea originally conceived by Hjalmar Schacht, the firm would issue 'MEFO bills' as payment to armament manufacturers, who in turn would exchange these for cash at the private banks.

 GER_Reinhardt:0 "Reinhardt Program"
 GER_Refin_desc:0 "In 1913 Friedrich Bergius discovered a process to turn coal into liquid hydrocarbons, which could then be used for further refining into petrochemicals.
